# Usage Guide

## Basic Usage

### Analyzing an Article
1. Navigate to any news article you want to analyze
2. Click the BiasDetector icon in your browser toolbar
3. Click "Analyze Article"
4. Wait for the analysis to complete (usually takes 15-30 seconds)

### Understanding the Results
The analysis results include:

- **Bias Score**: A 0-100 rating of overall bias (higher = more biased)
- **Bias Categories**: Types of bias detected (political, emotional, etc.)
- **Bias Instances**: Specific examples of biased language
- **Rewritten Article**: A more balanced version of the content
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Compare original and balanced versions

### Viewing the Rewritten Article
1. Once analysis is complete, click the "Rewritten" tab
2. Read the AI-generated neutral version of the article
3. Click "Compare" to see a side-by-side comparison highlighting changes

### Analyzing Missing Context
1. Click the "Missing Context" tab after analysis
2. Review the AI-identified important context that may be missing
3. This helps understand what perspectives or facts might be omitted

## Advanced Features

### Working with API Keys
For full functionality, you can use your own OpenAI API key:

1. Click the Settings button (gear icon)
2. Enter your OpenAI API key in the designated field

2. Check if the article content is properly loading
3. Ensure your API key is valid (if using one)
4. Some complex page layouts may not be properly detected
